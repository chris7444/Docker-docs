<title>Partition occupies all free space on boot drive</title>  
  
<p>In the previous release, when a disk size of 100GB was requested for the boot drive, the drive was configured accordingly in the VM but the size of the <codeph>/</codeph> partition was determined by the template. 
  The <codeph>/</codeph> partition is now resized to occupy all the free space of the boot drive. This fix has only been implemented for Linux VMs.

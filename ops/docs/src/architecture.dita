<title>Solution overview</title>

<p>The HPE Enterprise Containers as a Service with Docker EE solution consists of a set of Ansible playbooks that 
run on top of a VMware virtualization platform on HPE Synergy 
hardware. The solution allows you to configure a flexible OS environment (with both RHEL and Windows workers)  providing built-in
high availability (HA), container monitoring and security, and backup and restore functionality. This solution assumes 
that you  have already set up your HPE Synergy hardware, that you have installed your VMware virtualization platform 
and have configured HPE 3Par for storage.

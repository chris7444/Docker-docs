			<title>Enable vSphere High Availability</title>
			<body>
				<p>You must enable vSphere High Availability (HA) to support virtual machine failover during an HA event such as a host failure. Sufficient CPU and memory resources must be reserved across the system so that all VMs on the affected host(s) can fail over to remaining available hosts in the system. You configure an Admission Control Policy (ACP) to specify the percentage CPU and memory to reserve on all the hosts in the cluster to support HA functionality.</p>
				<note type="note">
				  <p>Note</p>
							<p>You should not use the default Admission Control Policy. Instead, you should calculate the memory and CPU requirements that are specific to your environment.</p>

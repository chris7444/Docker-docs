  <title>Solution lifecycle management</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      
      <p>Lifecycle management with respect to this solution refers to the maintenance and management
        of software and hardware of various components that make up the solution stack. Lifecycle
        management is required to keep the solution up-to-date and ensure that the latest versions
        of the software are running to provide optimal performance, security and fix any existing
        defects within the product.</p>
      
      <p>In this section, we will cover life cycle management of the different components that are
        used in this solution. </p>
      
      <p>The lifecycle of the following stacks need to be maintained and managed. </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Monitoring Tools (Splunk or Prometheus and Grafana</li>
        <li>Docker Enterprise Edition Environment</li>
        <li>Virtual Machine Operating systems</li>
        <li>Synergy environment</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>The general practice and recommendation is to follow a bottom-up approach for updating all
        components of the environment and making sure the dependencies are met. In our solution, we
        would start with Synergy and end with the monitoring
        environment. If all components are not being updated at the same time, the same approach can
        be followed â€“ updating only the components that require updates while adhering to the
        interdependencies of each component that is being updated.</p>

      <p>HPE Synergy Composer powered by HPE OneView provides fast, reliable, and simplified firmware and driver
management across many HPE Synergy components. HPE OneView manages firmware to reduce manual
interactions and errors, in addition to minimizing downtime. Firmware updates of management appliances and
shared infrastructure are nondisruptive to the production workload.

				<p>You must assemble the information required to assign values for each and every variable used by the playbooks, before you start deployment. The variables are fully documented in the following sections “Editing the group variables” and “Editing the vault”. A summary of the information required is presented in Table 3.</p>

									<p>L3 Network requirements</p>
								</entry>
								<entry>
									<p>You will need one IP address for each and every VM configured in the Ansible inventory (see the section “Editing the inventory”). At the time of writing, the example inventory configures 14 virtual machines so you would need to allocate 14 IP addresses to use this example inventory. Note that the Ansible playbooks do not support DHCP so you need static IP addresses. All the IPs should be in the same subnet. You will also have to specify the size of the subnet (for example /22 or /24) and the L3 gateway for this subnet.</p>

                                                  their names registered in DNS. In addition, you
                                                  will need the domain name to use for configuring
                                                  the virtual machines (such as <xref format="html" scope="external" href="http://example.com/">example.com</xref>)</p>

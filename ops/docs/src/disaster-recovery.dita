				<p>In order to protect your installation from
                                                  disasters, you need to take regular backups of the
                                                  swarm, UCP and DTR. In the event where half or
                                                  more manager nodes are lost and cannot be
                                                  recovered to a healthy state, the system is
                                                  considered to have lost quorum and can only be
                                                  restored through the manual procedure described in
                                                  the Docker documentation.</p>

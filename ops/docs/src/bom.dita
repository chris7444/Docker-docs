<body>
<!--<p>The following BOMs contain electronic license to use (E-LTU) parts. 
  Electronic software license delivery is now available in most countries. 
  HPE recommends purchasing electronic products over physical products (when available)
  for faster delivery and for the convenience of not tracking and managing confidential 
  paper licenses. For more information, please contact your reseller or an HPE representative.</p>

<note type="note">Part numbers are at time of publication and subject to change. 
  The bill of materials does not include complete support options or other rack 
  and power requirements. If you have questions regarding ordering, please consult 
  with your HPE Reseller or HPE Sales Representative for more details.

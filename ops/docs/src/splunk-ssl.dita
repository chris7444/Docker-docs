<title>Enabling SSL between the universal forwarders and the splunk indexers using your
certificates</title>
<body>
<section>
<title>Limitations</title>
<ul>
<li>This only works with Linux worker nodes</li>
<li>Universal Forwarders verify that the indexers they connect to have a certificate signed
by the configured root CA and that the Common Name in the certificate presented by the
indexer matches its fqdn as listed by the variable
<codeph>splunk_architecture_forward_servers</codeph>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<title>Prerequisites</title>
<ol>
<li>Configure your indexers to use SSL on port 9998. The following is an example inputs.conf
file located in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local that enables SSL on port 9998 and configures
the certificate file for use by the indexer itself. (here
/opt/splunk/etc/mycerts/indexer.pem). For more info see
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Security/ConfigureSplunkforwardingtousesignedcertificates.
In addition the following page tells you how to create your own certificates:
http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Security/Howtoself-signcertificates and
the content of the file designated with serverCert. In this case, the folder mycerts was
created under /opt/splunk/etc and the indexer.pem file was copied in this folder.
<codeblock>[splunktcp-ssl://9998]
disabled=0
connection_host = ip

[SSL]
serverCert=/opt/splunk/etc/mycerts/indexer.pem
#requireClientCert = true
#sslAltNameToCheck = forwarder,forwarder.cloudra.local

[tcp://1514]
connection_host = dns
sourcetype = ucp
</codeblock>
</li>
<li>Indexers are configured with the Root CA cert used to signed all certificates. This can
be done by editing the file server.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local on your
indexer(s). The following code block shows the relevant portion of this file where
sssRootCaPath is pointing to the root CA certificate. <codeblock>[sslConfig]
sslRootCAPath = /opt/splunk/etc/mycerts/ca.pem</codeblock>
<note type="note">In order to be able to download and install additional applications, you
may want to happend the file $SPLUNK_HOME/auth/appsCA.pem to your file ca.pem. If you
don;t do so, the Splunk UI will make this suggestion when you attempt to "Find more
apps"</note>
</li>
<li>Splunk should be restarted on the indexers if you had to make these changes (see the
Splunk documentation)</li>

</ol>
</section>

<section>
<title>Before you deploy</title>
<ol>
<li>Generate the forwarder certificate, give it the name forwarder.pem. Make sure you have a
copy of the root CA certificate and name the copy ca.pem</li>
<li>Copy ca.pem and forwarder.pem to files/splunk/linux/SPLUNK_HOME/etc/mycerts/ (erase the
existing files)</li>
<li>Edit the file server.conf under files/splunk/linux/SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local and
uncomment the last two lines as suggested in the file itself. Your file should look like
this
<codeblock>#
# uncomment the section below if you want to enable SSL
#
[sslConfig]
sslRootCAPath = /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/mycerts/ca.pem</codeblock>
</li>
<li>Edit group_vars/vars and uncomment the line splunk_ssl. Make sure the
splunk_architecture_forward_servers list specifies all your indexers together with the
port that was configured to accept SSL
<codeblock>monitoring_stack: splunk
splunk_ssl: yes
splunk_architecture_forward_servers:
- indexer1.cloudra.local:9998
- indexer2.cloudra.local:9998</codeblock>
</li>
</ol>
</section>



<section>
<title>Hybrid environment Linux/ Windows</title>
<p>Currently, you cannot deploy your own certificates for use by the Universal Forwarders
deployed on Windows machines. If you want to have your linux machines use SSL proceed as
indicated below</p>
<ol>
<li>Comment out the <codeph>splunk_architecture_forward_servers</codeph> (and its values)
from group_vars/vars
<codeblock>monitoring_stack: splunk
splunk_ssl: yes
#splunk_architecture_forward_servers:
#  - clh2-ansible.cloudra.local:9998</codeblock>
</li>
<li>create a file named vms.yml in the folder group_vars and specify the list of forward
servers to use by the linux servers. This list is typically the same as the one used for
windows servers but specifies a TCP port that enables SSL.
<codeblock>splunk_architecture_forward_servers:
- clh2-ansible.cloudra.local:9998</codeblock>
</li>
<li>edit the group_vars/win_worker.yml file and specify the list of forward servers to use by the windows servers.This list is typically the same as the one used for linux servers  but specifies a TCP port that does not enable SSL.
<codeblock>splunk_architecture_forward_servers:
- clh2-ansible.cloudra.local:9997</codeblock>
</li>

<title>Prerequisites</title>
<ul>
<li>VSphere clusters should have access to a datastore specifically for backups. This is a
separate Virtual Volume created on the 3PAR StoreServ and presented to all the hosts in
the vSphere cluster. </li>
<li>Backup software must be available. A recommendation for HPE Recovery Manager Central and
HPE StoreServ is included but other customer backup/restore solutions are acceptable </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<title>Restrictions</title>
<ul>
<li>Volumes may not be in use when a volume is cloned. Any container that has the volume
attached must be paused prior to creating the clone. The container can be resumed once the
clone is complete.</li>
<li>When docker volumes need to be restored from backup, the backup datastore needs to be
detached from all vSphere cluster servers prior to restoration.</li>
</ul>

<title>Creating the volume</title>
<p>Docker persistent volumes can be created from a worker node using the following
command:</p>
<codeblock>docker volume create --driver=vsphere --name=MyVolume@MyDatastore -o size=10gb </codeblock>
</section>

<section>
<title>Cloning the volume</title>
<note type="note">Prior to creating a clone of a volume, any containers accessing the volume
should be paused or stopped.</note>
<p>Docker volumes can be cloned to a new datastore:</p>
<codeblock>docker volume create --driver=vsphere --name=CloneVolumme@DockerBackup -o clone-from=MyVolume@MyDatastore -o access=read-only </codeblock>

<title>Snapshot and Backup 3PAR Virtual Volumes with Recovery Manager Central and
StoreOnce</title>
<p>HPE Recovery Manager Central (RMC) software integrates HPE 3PAR StoreServ All-Flash
arrays with HPE StoreOnce Systems to leverage the performance of snapshots with the
protection of backups. RMC uses a direct backup model to orchestrate data protection
between the array and the backup system without a backup application. When the first full
backup is complete, each subsequent backup is incremental, making it significantly faster
than traditional backup methods, particularly for higher volumes of data. Backups to HPE
StoreOnce are block-level copies of volumes, de-duplicated to save space. Because RMC
snapshots are self-contained, fully independent volumes, they can be restored to any 3PAR
array in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p>RMC enables you to replicate data from the source storage system (HPE 3PAR StoreServ) to
destination storage system (HPE StoreOnce). The replication is based on point-in-time
snapshots.</p>
<p>Recovery Manager Central is installed as a VM on VMware vSphere ESXi. It can be installed
on the Synergy platform on a separate (from the Docker Solution) vSphere cluster or
external to the Synergy environment as long as the external server has connectivity to the
HPE 3PAR StoreServ and HPE StoreOnce. RMC can be installed directly on an ESXi host or can
be deployed to a VMware vCenter managed environment. For this solution, the standalone
"RMC only" is installed. If RMC is installed in the Synergy environment, iSCSI connection
to the 3PAR StoreServ is required.</p>

<ul>
<li>The connectivity between HPE 3PAR StoreServ and RMC for data traffic is over iSCSI. </li>
<li>The connectivity between StoreOnce and RMC is over CoEthernet (Catalyst
OverEthernet)</li>
<li>The connectivity between RMC, HPE 3PAR StoreServ, and HPEStoreOnce for management
traffic is over IP. </li>

format="html">RMC User guide</xref> TODO PUBLIC URL NEEDED for detailed instructions on
setup and configuration of RMC and StoreOnce. When RMC is installed, it can be configured
with the Backup Appliance Persona. The Backup persona allows the RMC to manage snapshots
and Express Protect Backups. During installation, RMC configuration should specify Data
Protection of RMC Core. The initial configuration of backups can be set up using the
Protection Wizard. The Protection Wizard assists with creation of a Recovery Set. Create a
Recovery Set and select to protect your DockerBackup volume. Once you have created your
Recovery Set, the next step is to create Protection Jobs. The Auto Protection Job
simplifies the initial configuration of policies. The Auto Protection Job will
automatically configure the storage, define default backup policies and protection
policies and will schedule snapshots or express protect jobs with the created
policies.</p>

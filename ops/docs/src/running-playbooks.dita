<p>At this point, the system is ready to be deployed. Make sure you are logged on as root in your ansible box and that your current directory is <codeph>/root/Docker-Synergy/ops</codeph></p>

<p>To start a Linux-only deployment, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
<codeph># ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts site.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass</codeph>
</pre>
    
<p>The playbooks should run for 35-40 minutes depending on your server specifications and the size of your environment.</p>

    
<p>To start a hybrid, Windows and Linux deployment, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
<codeph># ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts hybrid.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass</codeph>
</pre>
        
<p>The playbooks should run for 70-80 minutes depending on your server specifications and the size of your environment. The increase in 
running time is primarily due to the need to update Windows after creating the VMs.</p>

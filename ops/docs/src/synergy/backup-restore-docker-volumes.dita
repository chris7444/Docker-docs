<title>Backup and restore Docker persistent volumes</title>
<body>
    

<p>There are a number of prerequisites that must be fulfilled before you backup and restore your Docker persistent volumes. </p>
    
<ul>
<li>VSphere clusters should have access to a datastore specifically for backups. This is a
separate Virtual Volume created on the HPE 3PAR StoreServ and presented to all the hosts in
the vSphere cluster. </li>
<li>Backup software must be available. HPE Recovery Manager Central and
HPE StoreServ is recommended but other customer backup and restore solutions are acceptable. </li>
</ul>



<p>A number of restrictions also apply:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>Volumes may not be in use when a volume is cloned. Any container that has the volume
attached must be paused prior to creating the clone. The container can be resumed once the
clone is complete.</li>
<li>When Docker volumes need to be restored from backup, the backup datastore needs to be
detached from all vSphere cluster servers prior to restoration.</li>
</ul>

<title>Creating the volume</title>
<p>Docker persistent volumes can be created from a worker node using the following
command:</p>
<codeblock>docker volume create --driver=vsphere --name=MyVolume@MyDatastore -o size=10gb </codeblock>
</section>

<section>
<title>Cloning the volume</title>
<note type="note">Prior to creating a clone of a volume, any containers accessing the volume
should be paused or stopped.</note>
<p>Docker volumes can be cloned to a new datastore:</p>
<codeblock>docker volume create --driver=vsphere --name=CloneVolumme@DockerBackup -o clone-from=MyVolume@MyDatastore -o access=read-only </codeblock>

<title>Snapshot and Backup 3PAR Virtual Volumes with HPE Recovery Manager Central and
HPE StoreOnce</title>
    
<p>HPE Recovery Manager Central (RMC) software integrates HPE 3PAR StoreServ All-Flash
arrays with HPE StoreOnce Systems to leverage the performance of snapshots with the
protection of backups. RMC uses a direct backup model to orchestrate data protection
between the array and the backup system without a backup application. When the first full
backup is complete, each subsequent backup is incremental, making it significantly faster
than traditional backup methods, particularly for higher volumes of data. Backups to HPE
StoreOnce are block-level copies of volumes, de-duplicated to save space. Because RMC
snapshots are self-contained, fully independent volumes, they can be restored to any 3PAR
array in the event of a disaster. See 
    <xref href="backup-restore-docker-volumes.dita#backup-solution/rmc-storeonce" type="fig"/> 
    for an overview of the architecture.</p>
    
<p>HPE Recovery Manager Central enables you to replicate data from the source storage system (HPE 3PAR StoreServ) to
the destination storage system (HPE StoreOnce). The replication is based on point-in-time
snapshots.</p>
    
<p>HPE Recovery Manager Central is installed as a VM on VMware vSphere ESXi. It can be installed
on the HPE Synergy platform on a separate (from the Docker Solution) vSphere cluster or
external to the Synergy environment as long as the external server has connectivity to the
HPE 3PAR StoreServ and HPE StoreOnce. HPE RMC can be installed directly on an ESXi host or can
be deployed to a VMware vCenter managed environment. For this solution, the standalone
"RMC only" is installed. If HPE RMC is installed in the HPE Synergy environment, iSCSI connection
to the HPE 3PAR StoreServ is required.</p>

</fig>
    
<ul>
<li>The connectivity between HPE 3PAR StoreServ and HPE RMC for data traffic is over iSCSI. </li>
<li>The connectivity between HPE StoreOnce and HPE RMC is over CoEthernet (Catalyst
OverEthernet)</li>
<li>The connectivity between HPE RMC, HPE 3PAR StoreServ, and HPE StoreOnce for management
traffic is over IP. </li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to <xref
href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-a00042435en_us"
format="html" scope="external">HPE RMC User guide</xref> for detailed instructions on
setup and configuration of RMC and StoreOnce. When RMC is installed, it can be configured
with the Backup Appliance Persona. The Backup persona allows the RMC to manage snapshots
and Express Protect Backups. During installation, RMC configuration should specify Data
Protection of RMC Core. The initial configuration of backups can be set up using the
Protection Wizard. The Protection Wizard assists with creation of a Recovery Set. 
</p>
<p>Create a
Recovery Set as shown in <xref href="backup-restore-docker-volumes.dita#backup-solution/recovery-set-overview" type="fig"/>
and select to protect your <codeph>DockerBackup</codeph> volume. Once you have created your
Recovery Set, the next step is to create Protection Jobs. The Auto Protection Job
simplifies the initial configuration of policies. The Auto Protection Job will
automatically configure the storage, define default backup policies and protection
policies and will schedule snapshots or express protect jobs with the created
policies.</p>
    
<fig id="recovery-set-overview">

</fig>
<p>RMC uses the Express Protect feature, as shown in <xref href="backup-restore-docker-volumes.dita#backup-solution/express-protect" type="fig"/>,
    to enable the backup of the snapshot data from the
3PAR array to the StoreOnce system for deduplication and long-term retention. </p>
    
<fig id="express-protect">

<image href="../media/express-protect.png"/>
</fig>
<p>The Express Restore feature restores either snapshots or base volumes.</p>
<p>RMC leverages 3PAR StoreServ SnapDiff technology to create an application-consistent
snapshot. Only changed blocks are sent to the StoreOnce system, which minimizes network
traffic and saves disk space on the backup system. </p>

<title>Restoring the volume</title>
<p>If a Docker persistent storage volume needs to be restored from backup, the 3PAR volume
can be restored either from a snapshot saved on the 3PAR or from a backup on StoreOnce.
Stop any applications using the Docker volume. Use vSphere Web UI to unmount the datastore
from the vSphere cluster. Use RMC to detach the 3PAR virtual volumes prior to restoring
the backup. The volume can be restored from a Recovery Set restore point as shown in
<xref href="backup-restore-docker-volumes.dita#backup-solution/restore-points" type="fig"/>. The Express
Protect restore point will restore the volume from the StoreOnce system. A Snapshot Set
restore point will restore a 3PAR StoreServ snapshot.</p>
    
<fig id="restore-points">

<image href="../media/restore-points.png"/>
</fig>
<p>Once the 3PAR virtual volume is restored, the volume must be reattached to the vSphere
cluster from RMC. After the volume is reattached, the datastore must be mounted.
Applications can then access the restored docker volume.</p>

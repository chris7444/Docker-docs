			<title>Deploying the vSphere Volume PlugIn:</title>
			<body>
				<p><b>Editors Note</b>: I had attempted to
                                                  add the vSphere Volume plugin to the ESXi golden
                                                  image but it does not work. I have reported this
                                                  issue to the Image Streamer team. The ESXi 6.5
                                                  image can't be modified. All changes are lost as
                                                  soon as it reboots. The existing Image Streamer
                                                  capture ESXi scripts to create golden images which
                                                  are supposed to remove all customizations also do
                                                  not work. The only thing I could get to work is
                                                  creating the "vanilla" ESXi 6.5 golden
                                                  image and using the existing Image Streamer
                                                  scripts to do the customization. Therefore, the
                                                  addition of the vSphere Volume Plugin is not
                                                  automated. Using the vSphere Update Manager seemed
                                                  like the best option however even that requires
                                                  additional steps as the package provided by VMware
                                                  doesn't restart the hostd service and the plugin
                                                  is unusable until you do that.</p>
				<p/>
				<p>After the new ESXi host is imported into vCenter, you can use the vSphere Update manager to install the vSphere Volume PlugIn.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>From vSphere Web Client, select your ESXi host</li>
					<li>Select the Update Manager tab</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Attach the baseline "ESXi 6.5 Docker Patch Extension" to your host.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Select Scan for Updates and choose Patches and Extensions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Select Remediate - you should see the VDVS_Driver BuiltIn</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep the defaults for the Advanced and remediation options, click Finish. It doesn't refresh automatically but you can select anything else and return to this page and it should show that host is now compliant.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<p>The Docker Extension is now installed on the ESXi host but you have to restart the service in order to use it. Going back to the iLO session, you can select Alt F1 to go to the CLI and restart the hostd service. After logging in, enter</p>
				<ul>
					<li>/etc/init.d/hostd restart</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<ph>
						
					</ph>
				</p>
				<p>If you use the esxcli storage guestvol command you can now see the status.</p>

<title>Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana</title>
<body>
<p>The solution can be configured to enable the use of Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
In this setup, there is no need for native installs and all the required monitoring software runs in containers,
deployed as either services or stacks. 
The load among the three hosts will be shared as 
per <xref href="promgraf-overview.dita#promgraf-overview/simplivity-ops-architecture-promgraf" type="fig"/>.</p>

<!--<p>These nodes can live in any of the hosts and they are not redundant. </p>-->

<p>The Prometheus
and Grafana services are declared in a Docker stack as replicated services with one
replica each, so if they fail, Docker EE will ensure that they are restarted on one
of the UCP VMs. cAdvisor and node-exporter are declared in the same stack as global
services, so Docker EE will ensure that there is always one copy of each running on
every machine in the cluster.</p>
    
<note type="note">
Prometheus and Grafana functionality is not turned on by default in this solution - 
see the section on Configuration for more information on how to enable these tools.
Additionally, this functionality will not work for the Windows worker nodes in your environment at present.

<title>Install vSphere Docker Volume Service driver on all ESXi hosts</title>
<body>
    
<p>vSphere Docker Volume Service technology enables stateful containers to access the
storage volumes. Setting this up is a one-off manual step. In order to be able to use Docker
volumes using the vSphere driver, you must first install the latest release of the
vSphere Docker Volume Service (vDVS) driver, which is available as a vSphere
Installation Bundle (VIB). To perform this operation, log in to each of the ESXi hosts and then
download and install the latest release of vDVS driver.</p>

<codeblock># esxcli software vib install -v /tmp/vmware-esx-vmdkops-&lt;version&gt;.vib --no-sig-check</codeblock>

<p>More information on how to download and install the driver can be found at <xref

href="http://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-docker/documentation/install.html"
>http://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-docker/documentation/install.html</xref>.
The version of the driver tested in this configuration is 0.21.2.

<note type="note">
<p>You cannot mount the same persistent volume created through vSphere Docker Volume
Service (vDVS) on containers running on two different hosts at the same time.</p>
